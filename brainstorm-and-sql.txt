Features:
- users can sign into the app with their email and password
- users can create recipes with ingredients and instructions
- recipes can be marked as public or private
- users can view other people’s recipes
- ingredients from recipes can be added to user’s grocery lists
- users can create their own occasions and assign recipes to occasions

Brainstorm:

Info we need to track:
- User id
- Username
- User email
- User password
- Recipe Names
- Recipe Ingredients
- Recipe Instruction
- Recipe public/private
- Occassions
- "Likes"

The onboarding screen allows a user to sign in with their email & password. From there, they can see new recipes from other users, visit their own profile (which shows their recipes & occassions), visit other users' profiles (showing that user's recipes & occassions), or search for specific occassions, recipes, or ingredients (the search function will then show occassions and recipes that use the search terms, ranked by "Likes").

Table Ideas:

Users - holds username, email, password, and user id. Each row is an individual user.
Recipes - holds recipe id, user id, "likes", recipe name, occassion, recipe ingredients, recipe instructions, and public/private setting. Each row is an individual recipe.
Occassions - holds occassions, occassion id, and assigned recipes. Each row is an individual occassion.
Grocery Lists - holds user id and ingredients. Each row is an individual user's list.

Relationships:

1 - 1:
Users table & Grocery Lists table, because each User has exactly one Grocery List.

1 - M:
Users table & Recipes table, because one User can have many Recipes but each Recipe is made by only one User.

M - M:
